    <h2>Welcome to the Animal Rights Homepage</h2>
    <p>ISSUES
        The animal rights movement, sometimes called the animal liberation movement, animal personhood, or animal advocacy movement, is a social movement  which seeks an end to the rigid moral and legal distinction drawn between human and non-hum an animals, an end to the status of animals as property, and an end to their use in the research, food, clothing, and entertainment industries.
        
        <h2>ANIMALS FOR EXPERIMENTATION</h2>
        Right now, millions of mice, rats, rabbits, primates, cats, dogs, and other animals are locked inside barren cages in laboratories across the globe. They languish in pain, ache with loneliness, and long to be free. Instead, all they can do is sit and wait in fear of the next terrifying and painful procedure that will be performed on them.

        <h2> FOR ENTERTAINMENT</h2>
        Animals aren‚Äôt actors, spectacles to imprison and gawk at, or circus clowns. Yet thousands of these animals are forced to perform silly, confusing tricks under the threat of physical punishment; are carted across the country in cramped and stuffy boxcars or semi-truck trailers; are kept chained or caged in barren, boring, and filthy enclosures; and are separated from their families and friends‚Äîall for the sake of human ‚Äúentertainment.‚Äù Many of these animals even pay with their lives.

        <h2>ANIMALS FOR CLOTHING</h2>
        Every year, millions of animals are killed for the clothing industry‚Äîall in the name of fashion. Whether the clothes come from Chinese fur farms, Indian slaughterhouses, or the Australian outback, an immeasurable amount of suffering goes into every fur-trimmed jacket, leather belt, and wool sweater.

        <h2>COMPANION ANIMALS</h2>
        For every lucky dog or cat who has a comfortable home, nutritious food, and loving guardians, countless other dogs and cats are suffering at the hands of incompetent or abusive people, are struggling to survive on the streets, or are waiting in animal shelters for a good home.
